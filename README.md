# F1 Driver Reaction Test 🏎️💨

Test your reflexes like a Formula 1 driver! This interactive web application simulates the F1 start sequence, challenging you to launch your car exactly when the lights go out.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **The Sequence:** Click "LAUNCH" (or press Spacebar) to initiate the start sequence.
2.  **The Lights:** Watch as the 5 red lights turn on one by one.
3.  **The Start:** Once all 5 lights are on, wait for them to go out.
4.  **The Reaction:** Click "LAUNCH" (or press Spacebar) **IMMEDIATELY** when the lights disappear.
5.  **The Result:**
    - **Success:** Your reaction time will be displayed in milliseconds.
    - **False Start:** If you click while the lights are still red, you get a "JUMP START" penalty!

## 🌟 Features

- **Cockpit View:** Immersive overlay simulating an F1 driver's helmet visor.
- **Day & Night Modes:** Toggle between a bright daytime track (Monza style) and a neon-lit night race (Singapore style).
- **Realistic Timing:** Random start delay (0.2s - 3.0s) just like in real F1 to prevent guessing.
- **Precision:** Reaction time measured in milliseconds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom animations, gradients, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Game logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.
